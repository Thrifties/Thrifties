🌟 About Me 🌟

Kenshin here, a dedicated software engineer and issue-solver. When I was young, I began my voyage into the world of code, and ever since then, I've been on an exhilarating trip discovering the vast regions of programming.

🌱 Learning & Growing 🌱

I really believe in the value of lifelong learning, and one of my favorite resources for finding and participating in open-source projects is GitHub. I'm excited to impart my experience and pick up knowledge from the bright brains in this thriving community.
